            <section>
                <p>My second semester as a college freshman started on January 19th, 2021, 98 days ago. Since then, I've
                    visited 83,909 web pages using Safari on my MacBook. Page visits are counted as any URL I click on
                    or search for. If I were to include pages I visited on the other browsers and devices I used, that
                    number would probably be around 100,000. But for purposes of clarity, I'll stick to using the 83,909
                    number in the rest of this story. Twitter is my most visited website, making up 15.7% of my total
                    number visited pages. GitHub, a popular website for maintaining and hosting code (such as this
                    story), comes in second at 13.4%. Google, YouTube, and Google Docs follow.
                </p>
                <p>An enormous number of the pages I visit are owned by just a few organizations: Google (Docs, Drive,
                    Gmail, Groups, Analytics, Calendar, YouTube), Facebook (Messenger, Instagram), Amazon (Twitch), or
                    the University of Michigan.
                </p>
                <p>Some quick math says that I visited around 856 web pages a day, about one page every 2 minutes. So
                    does that mean I have a 2-minute attention span? Well, unfortunately Safari doesn't actually track
                    how much time I spend on a web page. Or, at least it doesn't provide a way for me to access that
                    data; I'm sure Apple actually does keep track. Nonetheless, from my own judgement, 2 minutes does
                    seem like an accurate number to describe the amount of time I spend on most pages, and I think
                    that's a good thing.

                                How can a 2-minute attention span possibly be a good thing? Consider my usage of Genius,
                                a lyric website that I visited 435 times this semester.

                                316 of those visits were within a 12-hour time period from February 3rd to February 4th
                                in trying to find a suitable song for my Close Reading paper.

                                Over that time period, I looked at 114 unique song pages. Most <span

                                hours. I often <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.5)">revisited</span>
                                songs to get a better grasp of the lyrics. The only reason I was able to get through so
                                many songs was because of my "short" attention.<br>

                            <p>But I have to be honest and complete the full picture of that timespan. I visited 342
                                other web pages, most of which weren't related to researching lyrics.</p>

                <p>
                    There are 2 basic but important takeaways from those 12 hours.
                </p>
                <p><b>Research is a messy task</b>, especially on the Internet. But there is a method to the madness. A
                    person needs to allocate time to explore different sources, and quickly be able to determine which
                    ones are viable. Once options are narrowed down, the person needs to spend more time with a source
                    for further analysis or elimination. Any creative or analytical work is an optimization problem, and
                    it's an incredibly valuable skill to know how to optimize efficiently on the Internet. To someone
                    unfamiliar, it might seem like we're just scrolling through a page, barely taking in any of the
                    content. But really, I think we've just gotten really good at optimizing.
                </p>
                <p><b>I get easily distracted</b>, but that's okay. In fact, distraction is almost necessary. With the a
                    high volume of information I took in after reading each song's lyrics, I needed time to debrief and
                    subconsciously take everything in before diving in again. Apparently after my initial exploration
                    phase, I took several hours just watching YouTube videos before finally revisiting the song pages to
                    finalize my processing. There's only so much sustained attention a person can give to a task before
                    naturally losing steam.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>I think I can speak for most people in my generation in saying that a lot of our time is spent
                    online. This has become increasingly true over the course of the pandemic; our personal and
                    academic and work lives have become so intertwined it's hard to untangle. We can understand our own
                    interests, beliefs and worries through what we browse on the Internet.</p>
