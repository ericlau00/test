                <p>My second semester as a college freshman started on January 19th, 2021, 98 days ago. Since then, I've
                    visited 72,595 web pages using Safari on my MacBook. Page visits are counted as any URL I click on
                    or search for. If I were to include pages I visited on the other browsers and devices I used, that
                    number would probably be around 100,000. But for purposes of clarity, I'll stick to using the 72,595
                    number in the rest of this story. Twitter is my most visited website, making up 14.6% of my total
                    number visited pages. GitHub, a popular website for maintaining and hosting code (such as this
                    story), comes in second at 14.4%. Google, YouTube, and Google Docs follow.
                </p>
                <p>Some quick math says that I visited around 741 web pages a day, one page every 2 minutes. So does
                    that mean I have a 2-minute attention span? Well, unfortunately Safari doesn't actually track how
                    much time I spend on a web page. Or, at least it doesn't provide a way for me to access that data;
                    I'm sure Apple actually does keep track. Nonetheless, from my own judgement, 2 minutes does seem
                    like an accurate number to describe the amount of time I spend on most pages, and I think that's a
                    good thing.

                                Consider my usage of Genius, a lyric website that I visited 435 times this semester.
                                316 of those visits were within a 12-hour time period from February 3rd to February 4th
                                in trying to find a suitable song for my Close Reading paper.
                            </p>

                        <div class="step">
                            <p>
                                Over that time period, I looked at 114 unique song pages. Most <span
                                    style="background-color: #ffff648c;">exploration</span> occured within the first few
                                hours. I often <span style="background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.5)">revisited</span>
                                songs to get a better grasp of the lyrics. The only reason I was able to get through so many 
                                songs was because of my "short" attention.<br>
